# System for Testing Java and Haskell Hometasks in ITMO University

## How it works

Program pulls emails from your Google mailbox and parses the tasks from their attachments. Then, depending on whether it's a Java task or a Haskell task, it launches different compilers and checks the results. After that, it creates (or finds) a Google Doc with results and upload them there.

To launch it just dowload the .jar file from the **Releases** tab.
